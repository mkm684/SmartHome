1- this project has two seperate projects . so there is the smart and client. 
2- photos in the client need to stay the same direcotry 
3- in eclipese create two projects and put the files in them as they are lited
here, and put the images in the client repository (like here too).
4- run the smart first (JavaDYnUI is the main), then run the client (demo_gui
is the main).
5-note donot create rooms with the same names, or devices with the same name
in one room. 

Thanks
